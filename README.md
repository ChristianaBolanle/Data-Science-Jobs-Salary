Data Science Jobs Analysis from @2020 to 2022
### The field of data science is relatively new, having emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Early data science jobs focused primarily on data warehousing and business intelligence, with data scientists working to extract insights from structured data stored in databases. As the amount of data being generated and collected grew, so did the need for more advanced techniques and tools to analyze it. This led to the development of big data technologies, such as Hadoop and Spark, and the rise of new data science roles focused on working with unstructured data and using machine learning to extract insights. Today, data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that encompasses a wide range of skills, including statistics, programming, and domain expertise. Data scientists are now employed in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and technology, to help organizations make better decisions by turning data into actionable insights
